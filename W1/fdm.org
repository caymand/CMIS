Sampling on regular grid
+ Same distance within each vertex
+ Sampling precision is given by dx

Forward difference approximation
Central difference approximation

Laplacian operator
+ fxx + fyy + fzz
+ If we take it on the vector u=[x,y, z]
  then this is just taking fxx, fyy, fzz on each coordinate
