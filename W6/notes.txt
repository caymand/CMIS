Experiments
	+ Convergence studies
	+ Ground truth - set the system in equilibrium
	+ Fill pattern, eigenvalues

Theory
	+ Gauss divergence theorem

Boundary is piece-wise continous
	- Each piece is continous

Leibniz rule for differentiation

Normal at an edge is the same

Integral of g(u)
	This is just equivalent to evaluating g(u) * Ve
	We store u at the nodal positions and multiply by the volume
	of the current element.

Only when we apply FDM and numerical integration we introduce approximation
errors
